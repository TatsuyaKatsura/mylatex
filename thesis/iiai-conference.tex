\section*{Abstract}
In this paper we propose a platform of pattern matching system that can extract required phrases or sentences in texts.
Finding certain expressions in texts are often needed in language learning, e.g, examples of case markers
between a predicate and an argument, or possible nouns in subject of a verb in a certain meaning. In previous studies,
several types of systems, containing concordancers, are proposed; however, language learner

The concordancer used by language learners has fixed templeates of search patterns and user use it on them
less flexibility. 
the user want to apply othe type of pattern matching, they are reruied to build new program, but this is too cost.
Thus, we propose a platform of text searching system in which users can edit their search patterns
with complext  by combining blocks of basic search patterns. As a characteristics advantage of the proposed
system is user can also designate the highligting part in texts, e.g, phrase or words,
with the combination block pattern. To realize the pattern matching of predicate-argument structure,
the system emplopys several NLP tools. In performance test, experimental results show architecture of system 
thanks to the architecture, our system deal with large sclale texts (10,000 texts) because of database system. 


by devising architecture 
In this paper we discuss the 

and display parts, and the degree of freedom is limited. In order to create more free patterns, it is necessary to create them by program, but it is not easy because it requires skills different from language learning. Therefore, in this study

\section{Introduction}

This document is a {\LaTeX} template for IIAI Open Conference Publication Series. 
If you prefer to use Microsoft Word, please download the file from the conference webpage.
{\bf Do not change the font sizes or line spacing to squeeze more text into a limited number of pages. }
Use italics for emphasis; do not underline.  
The page limit is defined separately for each volume. Please do not exceed the page limit. 

\section{Copyright}
An IIAI electronic copyright form should accompany your final submission or registration of the conference. The instruction of copyright transfer is announced at the conference webpage. Authors are responsible for obtaining any security clearances for the copyright form submission.


\section{Figures and Tables}
To insert images in the paper, use outlined .eps/.pdf file of high resolution.  
Each figure should have a caption giving a brief explanation of the figure. 
If the figure includes copyrighted images, the author needs to get permission from copyright holders. 
Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use words rather than symbols. 
If the image includes non-English word or symbols, explain their meanings. 
Each table should also have a caption. 

\begin{comment}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[clip,width=10.0cm]{./fig1.eps}
    \caption{Example}
    \label{fig:example}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{comment}
Because IIAI will do the final editing formatting of your paper, 
you do not need to pay much attention to figures and tables position. 
Large figures and tables may be divided into multiple figures. 
Place figure captions below the figures; place table titles above the tables. 
If your figure has two parts, include the labels ``(a)'' and ``(b)'' as part of the artwork. 
Please verify that the figures and tables you mention in the text actually exist. 
Please do not include captions as part of the figures. 
Do not put captions in ``text boxes'' linked to the figures. 
Do not put borders around your figures. 
Please do not abbreviate ``Figure'' and ``Table'' like ``Fig'' and ``Tbl'' in the text. 

Figures in print will appear in grayscale (black and white), though the full color version will appear in the electronic version of your published manuscript. Any copyrighted image must include indication in the caption of the original source of the image and that it is being used with permission of the copyright holder. Authors may have to pay the permission fee when the copyright holder of the image requires it.




\section{References}

Number citations consecutively in square brackets \cite{1}. 
The sentence punctuation follows the brackets \cite{2}. 
Multiple references are each numbered with separate brackets \cite{1}\cite{2}\cite{3}. 
When citing a section in a book, please give the relevant page numbers. 
In sentences, refer simply to the reference number, as in \cite{3}. 
Do not use ``Ref. \cite{3}'' or ``reference \cite{3}'' except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{3} shows ... .'' 
Do not put citations and references in footnotes. 
References in the references list should appear in the order of appearance in the paper. 
Give all authors’ names; do not use ``et al.'' unless there are six authors or more. 
Use a space after authors' initials. 
Papers that have not been published should be cited as ``unpublished'' [4]. 
Papers that have been submitted for publication should be cited as ``submitted for publication'' [5]. 
Papers that have been accepted for publication, but not yet specified for an issue should be cited as ``to be published'' [6]. 
Please give the URL and the date of access for webpage citation [7].
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols. 
For papers published in translated journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation [8]. If the papers are 
published in non-English languages, translate the paper title and journal name. IIAI does not recommend to refer non-English language publications. 
IIAI journals employ IEEE transaction reference style.

\section{Some Common Mistakes}

Do not use the word which has plural meaning. 
Use the word ``micrometer'' instead of ``micron.'' 
A graph within a graph is an ``inset,'' not an ``insert.'' 
The word ``alternatively'' is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates). 
Use the word ``whereas'' instead of ``while'' (unless you are referring to simultaneous events). 
Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively.'' 
Do not use the word `issue'' as a euphemism for ``problem.'' 
Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones `affect'' (usually a verb) and ``effect'' (usually a noun), ``complement'' and ``compliment,'' ``discreet'' and ``discrete,'' ``principal'' (e.g., ``principal investigator'') and ``principle'' (e.g., ``principle of measurement''). Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer.'' 
Prefixes such as `non,'' ``sub,'' ``micro,'' ``multi,'' and ``ultra'' are not independent words; they should be joined to the words they modify, usually without a hyphen. 
There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.'' (it is also italicized). 
The abbreviation ``i.e.,'' means ``that is,'' and the abbreviation ``e.g.,'' means ``for example'' (these abbreviations are not italicized). 



\section{Editorial Policies for General Issues}

\subsection{General Issues/Special Issues (Non Conference Related Papers)}

Submission of a manuscript is not required for presentation/participation in a conference. 
Do not submit a reworked version of a paper you have submitted or published elsewhere. 
The submitting author is responsible for obtaining the agreement of all coauthors and any consent required from sponsors before submitting a paper. IIAI Journals strongly discourage courtesy authorship. 
It is the obligation of the authors to cite relevant prior work. 
At least three to four reviewers are required for every paper submitted. 
Undecipherable English is a valid reason for rejection. 


\subsection{Special Issues (Conference Related Papers)}

For conference-related papers, the decision to accept or reject a paper is made by the guest editors of the special issues. Guest editors may be appointed by conference organizing committees. 
Do not submit a reworked version of a paper you have submitted or published elsewhere. 
Conference paper should be extended/improved from the original version. 
The extended/improved version should include at least 10 references. 
Undecipherable English is a valid reason for rejection. 
Authors of rejected papers may revise and resubmit them to an IIAI journal as regular papers, whereupon they will be reviewed by three to four new referees. 



\section{Publication Principle}

This publication principle is created based on IEEE transaction publication policies. 
Authors should consider the following points. 
Except for the papers which were already reviewed by technical committees, each submitted paper will be reviewed rigorously.

\subsection{Technical Papers}

\noindent
{\bf (1)  Novelty and relevancy:} Technical papers submitted for publication must advance the state of knowledge and must cite relevant prior work. 

\noindent
{\bf (2)  Page length and contents:} The length of a submitted paper should be commensurate with the importance, or appropriate to the complexity, of the work. For example, an obvious extension of previously published work might not be appropriate for publication or might be adequately treated in just a few pages.

\noindent
{\bf (3)  Significance of the work:} Authors must convince both peer reviewers and the editors of the scientific and technical merit of a paper; the standards of proof are higher when extraordinary or unexpected results are reported. 

\noindent
{\bf (4)  Information disclosure:} Because replication is required for scientific progress, papers submitted for publication must provide sufficient information to allow readers to perform similar experiments or calculations and use the reported results. Although not everything needs to be disclosed, a paper must contain new, useable, and fully described information. Authors should expect to be challenged by reviewers if the results are not supported by adequate data and critical details.

\noindent
{\bf (5)  Incomplete work:} Papers that describe ongoing work or announce the latest technical achievements, which are suitable for presentation at a professional conference, may not be appropriate for publication in a volume.
